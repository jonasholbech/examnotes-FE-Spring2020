## Our preparation

We have

1.  Read your report
2.  Wathed your screencasts
3.  Played around with your solution(s)
4.  Read your code
5.  Glanced at your branches

Since we have seen your solution, you are not **required** to show how it looks. But if you have a point about something, please show and share

## Your preparation

1. Prepare a presentation
2. Have the solution open (or ready to npm start)
3. Have your editor open

You can continue working on fixing UI/UX/DEV issues, BUT

1.  Do it on a `fork`
2.  Do not merge it into original
3.  Do not overwrite what you've handed in
4.  Don't do crazy add-ons
